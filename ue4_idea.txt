UE4 game:
	Aim:
		-- Implementation of different concepts and features
		-- Fully working demo with free assets from web/assetstores/marketplaces
		-- Min. 10 minutes play time
		-- Design friendly
		-- Learn how to do things from tries and failures (there will be many failures so implement everything to be easily changed, moved, removed or improved)
		-- YEAH, I KNOW THAT IT IS RPG-LIKE BUT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE WHOLE GAME!

	Specs:
		-- TPP
		-- Fantasy (ha ha ha)
		-- Collision-based weapon system
		-- Spells
		-- Skills (longer duration of a spell, increased damage or armor etc.)

	Features:
		-- Movement system (maybe UE movement is good enough?)
		-- Camera system (maybe UE camera is good enough? Locking on enemies)
		-- Stats systems (every object should be able to define some stats)
		-- Player progression (unlocking quests, skills, world map places)
		-- Dialogue system (with camera transitions; dialogue choices; unlocking lines depending on world state (quests or events) or player stats (charisma for example))
		-- Class system (warrior, rogue, mage; enum?)
		-- Items system (item stats; item groups (normal, special, legendary); maybe integrated with class system (and player progression (XP) or stats))
		-- Weapon system (melee, ranged; based on items)
		-- Spells system (scrolls, skills? maybe both; based on items if scrolls are used)
		-- Skills system (buyable? if so then it would be nice to have this based on items; integrated with class system (and player progression (XP) or stats))
		-- Inventory system (integrated with items)
		-- Equipment system (integrated with items and inventory system (one way ticket))
		-- Shops system (integrated with dialogues and items)
		-- Enemies/AI
		-- Dungeons/arenas system (integrated with quests)
		-- Quests system (integrated with dialogues)
		-- Loot system (from enemies, boxes and other things)
		-- Cutscenes system (maybe derived from dialogues? or at least with common parts? or just cutscene1->dialogue1->cutscene2/cutscene3 (depending on choice))
		-- World map system (integrated with player progression)
		-- Seamless traveling the world
		-- Fast travel system (integrated with world map)
